Your task is to query the r/SpaceX API and display the results.

 

The documentation for the API is here:

https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/wiki

 

Call the API to get a list of all launches, and then display the ten latest. (This will be a combination of upcoming and recent.) You should show:

* the flight number,

* the launch date time,

* the rocket name,

* whether or not this is a past or upcoming launch,

* and if it is a past launch, whether or not the launch was a success.

* a link/button to more information.

 

If you click the link/button for more information, you should show some additional information about the launch and the rocket:

Launch details:

• the details of the launch, if it has any

• the name of the launch site

• the mission_patch image, if it has one

Rocket Details:

• the rocket name and ID

• height

• mass

• how many stages it has

• a description of the rocket.

(This will require a separate call to fetch the rocket information. This info can be displayed as a modal or a separate page or however you like.)

 

Build details, design, and choices for framework are your decision to make. I recommend react, but if you're not familiar, don't feel compelled to use it.

 

Please submit your work as a git repo, or even just a URL to your site. (Be advised that we can't accept a zip attachment, as some email clients will refuse to send/attach a zip file if it contains any code/js.) Include any instructions to install/run if necessary, and any notes you'd like.

 

Take up to a few days to complete this, though I do not expect you to spend more than 4-5 hours. This is a code exercise, not a graphic design one. I look forward to seeing what you create!
